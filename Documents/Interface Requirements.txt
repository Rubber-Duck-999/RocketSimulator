Console:


Req - 001:
If stateDataParameters.currentState is set to CONFIGURED
Send terrainMissionParameters, launcherMissionParameters,
rocketDataParameters and stateDataParameters to the controller


Req - 002:
If stateDataParameters.currentState is set to LAUNCH
        Send stateDataParameters to the controller


Req - 003:
stateDataParameters.currentState cannot be moved from RETURN or SHUTDOWN unless stateDataParameters.currentState has been received and is of the state LAUNCH


Algorithm:


Req - 001:
If stateDataParameters.currentState is set to LAUNCH
Send algoData with update time based on timeToLaunch as basis.


Req - 002:
Time will not be calculated in outside time, it will based off systemTime and that all relies on timeToLaunch in stateDataParameters. This will be decided in the controller implementation
